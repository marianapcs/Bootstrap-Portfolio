# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
This is personal portfolio that showcases the use of Bootstrap as well as my recent projects as a Front-End Web Developer. It highlights deployed web applications, my contact details as well as a small image of myself for familiarity. 

This webpage not only showcases deployed applications created through refactoring, javascript skills but is heavily built on my Bootstrap.
